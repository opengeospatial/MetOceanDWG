== Overview

Event-driven workflows provide publish-subscribe based capabilities as part of information systems and architectures. The publish-subscribe model also provides efficiencies in providing data "as it happens", thereby alleviating potential clients from continuous polling to check on the availability of new data/resources.

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has conducted significant work on event-based models and architectures. The publish-subscribe model results in less network traffic and more timely responses to manage event-based models such as urgent, temporally unpredictable data (examples include, but are not limited to: weather or hazard warnings, sensor data).

Building on the OGC Publish-Subscribe Interface Standard, as well as the recommendations put forward in the OGC Pub/Sub White Paper (OGC 20-046) produced as part of OGC Testbed 12, this paper discusses approaches for integrating publish-subscribe architecture into the OGC API suite of standards.

== OGC API Considerations

The OGC API building block approach is typically implemented for shared components of APIs in support of polling workflow.  This means the client initiates and invokes requests and receives responses  from the server, using HTTP.  A key concept of the OGC API building blocks is the endpoint hierarchy, which can be applied for Pub/Sub workflow as follows:

* data producers: messages are published to a broker, applied to a given channel (example: ``collections/mycollection``)
* broker provisioning: published messages are sent to subscribers
* subscribers and data consumers: messages are received by users subscribed to one or more channels (explicitly or using wildcards/filtering)

The above workflow requires adherence to a hierarchy of channels, autodiscovery of channels, as well as processing of generic messages for broad interoperabilty by all components.

=== Channels, message payloads and OGC API endpoints

The OGC API endpoint hierarchy can be used in parallel as a channel description when the data publisher wishes to provide Pub/Sub capability for OGC API resources normally available in the same way. Below are examples of OGC endpoints normally available via HTTP, and how they can be re-used as topics for Pub/Sub workflow:

- ``/collections``: notifies Subscribers whenever there is a change to the ``/collections`` OGC API endpoint (for example, addition of a new collection). The message payload would be collection metadata as defined by OGC API - Common, or a message referencing same
- ``/collections/{collectionId}``: notifies Subscribers whenever there is an update to a single collection (for example, spatial or temporal extents, new items, etc.). The message payload would be defined by the resource model of the given collection (items, etc.), or a message reference same

For smaller payload workflow, OGC APIs can additionally provide a channel for notification metadata in order to receive a smaller message payload, which a user can process to determine whether to further interact with the reference data granule or resource.

Using the OGC API endpoint hierarchy provides the key benefit that OGC API users do not need to learn a different, additional approach or hierarchy for Pub/Sub (same content, additional interface).

=== AsyncAPI

Following the recommendations of the Pub/Sub White Paper, AsyncAPI provides an event-driven equivalent of what is provided by OpenAPI for OGC APIs (description of protocols, channels, parameters, models, etc.). An OGC API landing page can provide a link to an AsyncAPI document as follows:

    "rel": "http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/pubsub/asyncapi",
    "type": "application/json",
    "title": "AsyncAPI document",
    "href": "https://example.org/asyncapi"
}
----

=== Providing notification metadata as an OGC API endpoint

For Brokers providing notification metadata (as opposed to actual data payloads), an OGC API can, in parallel, easily provide GeoJSON-based notification messages via an OGC API - Features endpoint. Providing message payloads via an OGC API provides the additional benefit of querying for past messages over time in case of a lost connection.

== Recommendations for an OGC API - Pub/Sub standard

An OGC API - Pub/Sub standard can provide the below requirements, recommendations, and permissions for server implementations.

=== API conformance

It is appropriate to add a conformance class to describe that the service supports PubSub with reference to the specification that it uses to define the functionality. In doing so, we define the requirements class and the conformance class with a set of conformance tests covering a variety of protocol options that ensure compliance with the standard. 

An OGC API server SHALL provide a mechanism to define the protocols and message schemas it supports, following the convention in the use of OpenAPI to describe OGC API's, as well as the `/conformance` endpoint.  An API SHALL NOT mandate any encoding or format for the formal definition of the API. This approach has allowed OGC API's to take advantage of industry best practices for describing functionality.  At the time of writing, AsyncAPI can be defined as the preferred option.

=== API definition

A link to the Pub/Sub definition document for the service SHALL be provided on the service landing page `/` as a link with a defined link relation as per IANA:footnote[https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml] or OGC API Standards.

=== Protocols and interoperability

An OGC API - Pub/Sub standard SHOULD NOT prescribe a protocol.  A asynchronous API definition (such as AsyncAPI, or equivalent technology), SHOULD be utilized to describe the interfaces supported by a service.

=== Message payloads

An OGC API - Pub/Sub server SHOULD NOT mandate a message payload, but SHALL define and advertise all payload formats/schemas as part of the API definition.  Examples include (but are not limited to) GeoJSON and various OGC API response schemas, of metadata or actual data payloads or references to same.

=== Channel descriptions

Channel (topic/destination/node depending on protocol) identifiers SHALL be based on the same naming hierarchy as the OGC API endpoints which are generating the events that users subscribe to.


== WMO WIS2 implementation

The WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) is the framework for WMO data sharing in the 21st century for all WMO domains and disciplines. It supports the WMO Unified Data policy, the Global Basic Observing Network (GBON) and makes international, regional, and national data sharing simple, effective, and inexpensive. The idea that no WMO~ Member should be left behind and the objective of lowering the barrier to adoption has been at the core of WIS 2.0 development. These objectives inspire the principles underpinning the WIS 2.0 technical framework, such as adopting open standards and Web technologies to facilitate sharing of increasing variety and volume of real-time datafootnote:[https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/wis].

Given the real-time nature of weather/climate/water data, WIS2 makes significant use of Pub/Sub standards and technologies, and has resulted in the following draft standards:

- WIS2 Notification Messagefootnote:[https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2-notification-message]
- WIS2 Topic Hierarchyfootnote:[https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2-topic-hierarchy]

Key core protocols and encodings of WIS2 are identified below:

- HTTP
- MQTT
- GeoJSON

A draft architecture is illustrated below, exemplifying the Pub/Sub interactions between WIS2 Nodes and the Global Broker (a WIS2 global service).

=== Protocols and Message Queuing Protocol (MQP) Brokers

WIS2 mandates use of a Message Queuing Protocol (MQP) using MQTT 3.1.1 and/or MQTT 5.0. MQTT can also be used over the Web using WebSockets, thereby providing the ability to build mobile and web applications.

=== Notification Message

The WIS2 standard notification message format ensures that the WIS2 ecosystem (data publisher, data user, and global services) is a robust, effective, and unified exchange platform for weather, climate, and water data. The message provides notification metadata about the availability of a new data granule.  The message is encoded using a GeoJSON baseline, and provides detailed information on the data notification (associated datetime of the granule, publishing datetime, integrity), as well as access to the data via a link object or inline content (useful for encoding small messages). Geometry is required (given GeoJSON requirements), however can be expressed with a ``null`` value when generating the geometry in the message is not possible, practical or timely for data publishers. To support extensibility, additional properties are also valid (given the default definition in JSON Schema).

Using a GeoJSON baseline as the message payload allows for broad interoperability given the large ecosystem of tooling (decoders, encoders) supporting the same approach. An example web application demonstrating the ease of integration can be found at https://kralidis.ca/tmp/wis2-data-notifications.html.

=== Topic hierarchy

The WIS2 topic hierarchy provides a central classification and categorization scheme used by data providers and WIS2 Global Services in support of core WIS2 workflows: publish, discover, subscribe and download, and is aligned with and implements WMO Res. 1 Cg-EXT-21 - Unified Data Policyfootnote:[https://ane4bf-datap1.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wmocms/s3fs-public/ckeditor/files/Cg-Ext2021-d04-1-WMO-UNIFIED-POLICY-FOR-THE-INTERNATIONAL-approved_en_0.pdf?4pv38FtU6R4fDNtwqOxjBCndLIfntWeR]. The topic hierarchy defines eight (8) core levels for all WIS2 data, and provides an extensibility framework for specific information communities (atmospheric composition, cryosphere, etc.) to define their own hierarchy as subdomains.

Combined with implementing MQP brokers, the topic hierarchy allows for subscribing and filtering of notification messages by data consumers.
