== Overview

Event-driven workflows provide publish-subscribe based capabilities as part of information systems and architectures. The publish-subscribe model also provides efficiencies in providing data "as it happens", thereby alleviating potential clients from continuous polling to check on the availability of new data/resources.

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has conducted significant work on event-based models and architectures. The publish-subscribe model results in less network traffic and more timely responses to manage event-based models such as urgent, temporally unpredictable data (examples include, but are not limited to: weather or hazard warnings, sensor data).

Building on the OGC Publish-Subscribe Interface Standard, as well as the recommendations put forward in the OGC PubSub White Paper (OGC 20-046) produced as part of OGC Testbed 12, this paper discusses approaches for integrating publish-subscribe architecture into the OGC API suite of standards.

== OGC API Considerations

=== Channels, message payloads and OGC API endpoints

The OGC API endpoint hierarchy can be used in parallel as a channel description when the data publisher wishes to provide PubSub capability for OGC API resources normally available in the same way. Below are examples of OGC endpoints normally available via HTTP, and how they can be re-used as topics for PubSub workflow:

- ``/collections``: notifies Subscribers whenever there is a change to the ``/collections`` OGC API endpoint (for example, addition of a new collection). The message payload would be collection metadata as defined by OGC API - Common
- ``/collections/{collectionId}``: notifies Subscribers whenever there is an update to a single collection (for example, spatial or temporal extents, new items, etc.). The message payload would be defined by the resource model of the given collection (items, etc.)

For smaller payload workflow, OGC APIs can additionally provide a channel for notification metadata in order to receive a smaller message payload, which a user can process to determine whether to further interact with the reference data granule or resource.

Using the OGC API endpoint hierarchy provides the key benefit that OGC API users do not need to learn a different, additional approach or hierarchy for PubSub (same content, additional interface).

=== AsyncAPI

Following the recommendations of the PubSub White Paper, AsyncAPI provides an event-driven equivalent of what is provided by OpenAPI for OGC APIs (description of protocols, channels, parameters, models, etc.). An OGC API landing page can provide a link to an AsyncAPI document as follows:

{
    "rel": "http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/pubsub/asyncapi",
    "type": "application/json",
    "title": "AsyncAPI document",
    "href": "https://example.org/asyncapi"
}
----

=== Providing notification metadata as an OGC API endpoint

For Brokers providing notification metadata (as opposed to actual data payloads), an OGC API can, in parallel, easily provide GeoJSON-based notification messages via an OGC API - Features endpoint. Providing message payloads via an OGC API provides the additional benefit of querying for past messages over time in case of a lost connection.

=== Providing PubSub links to collection updates

== Recommendations for an OGC API - PubSub standard

=== Conformance

A service MUST provide a mechanism to define the protocols and message schemas it supports but following the convention in the use of OpenAPI to describe OGC API's, it would not mandate any encoding or format for the formal definition of the API. This approach has allowed OGC API's to take advantage of industry best practice for describing functionality, at the time of writing AsyncAPI could be defined as the preferred option.

Add an extra conformance class for PubSub to inform users that the service supports PubSub and the specification that it uses to define the functionality.

=== API definition

A link to the PubSub definition document for the service MUST be provided on the service landing page `/`

=== Protocols and Interoperability

An OGC API - PubSub standard SHOULD not proscribe a protocol, AsyncAPI (or equivalent technology) would be utilised to describe the interfaces supported by a service in order to enable interoperability.  

=== Message payloads

OGC API - PubSub standard SHOULD not proscribe a message payload, but all payload formats/schemas MUST be defined by the advertised definition API  

=== Channel descriptions

Channel (topic/destination/node depending on protocol) identifiers SHOULD be based on the same naming hierarchy as the OGC endpoints which are generating the events that users subscribe to.


TODO: expand

* Protocol: any protocol (MQTT, AMQP, etc.)
* Message payload: GeoJSON as metadata, or actual data
* AsyncAPI: link object in OGC API landing page response ``links`` section
* Topic hierarchy / OGC API integration: use OGC API endpoints as channels, link objects and rels in collection metadata

== WMO WIS2 implementation

The WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) is the framework for WMO data sharing in the 21st century for all WMO domains and disciplines. It supports the WMO Unified Data policy, the Global Basic Observing Network (GBON) and makes international, regional, and national data sharing simple, effective, and inexpensive. The idea that no WMO~ Member should be left behind and the objective of lowering the barrier to adoption has been at the core of WIS 2.0 development. These objectives inspire the principles underpinning the WIS 2.0 technical framework, such as adopting open standards and Web technologies to facilitate sharing of increasing variety and volume of real-time datafootnote:[https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/wis].

Given the real-time nature of weather/climate/water data, WIS2 makes significant use of PubSub standards and technologies, and has resulted in the following draft standards:

- WIS2 Notification Messagefootnote:[https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2-notification-message]
- WIS2 Topic Hierarchyfootnote:[https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2-topic-hierarchy]

Key core protocols and encodings of WIS2 are identified below:

- HTTP
- MQTT
- GeoJSON

A draft architecture is illustrated below, exemplifying the PubSub interactions between WIS2 Nodes and the Global Broker (a WIS2 global service).

=== Protocols and Message Queuing Protocol (MQP) Brokers

WIS2 mandates use of a Message Queuing Protocol (MQP) using MQTT 3.1.1 and/or MQTT 5.0. MQTT can also be used over the Web using WebSockets, thereby providing the ability to build mobile and web applications.

=== Notification Message

The WIS2 standard notification message format ensures that the WIS2 ecosystem (data publisher, data user, and global services) is a robust, effective, and unified exchange platform for weather, climate, and water data. The message provides notification metadata about the availability of a new data granule.  The message is encoded using a GeoJSON baseline, and provides detailed information on the data notification (associated datetime of the granule, publishing datetime, integrity), as well as access to the data via a link object or inline content (useful for encoding small messages). Geometry is required (given GeoJSON requirements), however can be expressed with a ``null`` value when generating the geometry in the message is not possible, practical or timely for data publishers. To support extensibility, additional properties are also valid (given the default definition in JSON Schema).

Using a GeoJSON baseline as the message payload allows for broad interoperability given the large ecosystem of tooling (decoders, encoders) supporting the same approach. An example web application demonstrating the ease of integration can be found at https://kralidis.ca/tmp/wis2-data-notifications.html.

=== Topic hierarchy

The WIS2 topic hierarchy provides a central classification and categorization scheme used by data providers and WIS2 Global Services in support of core WIS2 workflows: publish, discover, subscribe and download, and is aligned with and implements WMO Res. 1 Cg-EXT-21 - Unified Data Policyfootnote:[https://ane4bf-datap1.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wmocms/s3fs-public/ckeditor/files/Cg-Ext2021-d04-1-WMO-UNIFIED-POLICY-FOR-THE-INTERNATIONAL-approved_en_0.pdf?4pv38FtU6R4fDNtwqOxjBCndLIfntWeR]. The topic hierarchy defines eight (8) core levels for all WIS2 data, and provides an extensibility framework for specific information communities (atmospheric composition, cryosphere, etc.) to define their own hierarchy as subdomains.

Combined with implementing MQP brokers, the topic hierarchy allows for subscribing and filtering of notification messages by data consumers.
